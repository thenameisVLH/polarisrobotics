<div>Outreach - We are team of FTC students interested in sharing our experiences and knowledge with the community. Our motto is to inspire the children into the path of robotics (STEM activities) at young age. Apart from our FTC team meeting time, we spend 5 to 10 hours weekly to mentor different FLL teams in the community and spread awareness about robotics.</div>
