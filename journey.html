<p2>We had 3 qualifiers from last year, 2020-2021:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>First Qualifier: This first qualifier was a great learning experience for us. We learned new skills that we implemented in our future competitions. Our first competition ended with us getting awarded the design award. </li>
    <br>
    <li>Second Qualifier: This second qualifier was also a good experience as we were able to do well during the interviews and also were able to improve our robot for the better. We won the 2nd place Design award for our 2nd qualifier.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Third Qualifier: This third qualifier improved our speaking wells and also allowed us to collaborate our as a team more efficiently. We won the Motivate Award and won the third-place Inspire Award allowing us to make it to regionals.</li>
